# bullseye-iOS

This a `code along` project design by [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/) and his team in their SwiftUI course.

It's a simple but fun game that allows the user to predict, by using a slider, the randomly generated number provided
The user is then provided a score based on how close their answer is to the random number.
